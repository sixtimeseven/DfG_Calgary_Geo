Pre Meeting Prep. Take a look at calgary's Open data portal and find anything I might have missed.
Git repo has been started use it as needed

Data Processing Task Sheet.

1. Make paths continuous. There are several examples where paths break when passing a street or road.
    Fix these and make it so on download we pull clean data (download data clean then save)

2. Fix "Bike Routes". Many roads are marked as a bike route yet are pretty dangerous due to speed or traffic volume.
    Use "Road classification" or any other data to remove dangerous roads from the dataset.

3. Merge in bridges and connectors. I couldn't find in the arcgis documentation tree.
    This data is available from open data portal. Find how to bring into the project. (https://data.calgary.ca/Recreation-and-Culture/Pathways-Connector-Data/a55h-pcwd)
4. Upgrades and future projects. I couldn't find in the arcgis documentation tree.
    This data is available from open data portal. Find how to bring into the project.

1. Look into "SweepRoutes" to see if there is a better prioritization (https://gis.calgary.ca/arcgis/rest/services/pub_CalgaryDotCa)
2. Look into "PavmentRehabPlan" to see if there is a better prioritization (https://gis.calgary.ca/arcgis/rest/services/pub_CalgaryDotCa)

3. Heat Map Based on location relative to infrastructure (<10 lines of code)

4. Build a graph representation
